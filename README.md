# Face-Recognition

The training process involves using the traditional networks to compare the input image from the webcam with the images of the user's face in the dataset. If the similarity between the input image and the user's face images exceeds a specified threshold, the system will print the message "hello," indicating that the user's face is recognized. However, if the face in the image belongs to someone else, the system will print the message "can't login."
